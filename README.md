Goal: To analyse and track the coronavirus outbreak and be aware of the actual stats that are affecting the areas that we live in and the whole world.Through this project we aim to perform an analyis on available data on COVID-19. We plan to use classifiers, unsupervised learning and forecasting to help arrive at our mentioned objectives.

Objectives:
1) Through our EDA, we are predicting the survival rate of individuals in USA and worldwide.
2) The model with all the coefficients leading to death or even infection
3) Prediction of the curve (when it is going to end and when it will flatten)
4) To implement an unsupervised learning model (K-means clustering) to identify for underlying groups or categories
   existing in our data and gain possible insights.
5) Best Forecasting model that would predict the optimal future trends.
